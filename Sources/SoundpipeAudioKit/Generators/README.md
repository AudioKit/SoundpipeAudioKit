# AudioKit Physical Models

These are physical models mostly based on STK physical models.  There are more [STK physical models available](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/classes.html) for conversion. 
If you need any of those, you can follow the code models or ask for help from the AudioKit core team.

## TODO

* Replace the current metal bar physical model with the STK version

* Add Marimba physical model from STK

* Add Vibes physical model from STK
